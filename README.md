**Build a Chatbot for your Data**  

### Introduction
In this project, you will create a chatbot for your own pdf file using Flask, a popular web framework, and Langchain, another popular framework for working with Large Language Models (LLMs). The chatbot you develop will not just interact with users via text but also comprehend and answer questions related to the content of a specific document.

Feel free to explore a demo of the final application that you will create!

By the completion of this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of chatbots, web application development using Flask and Python, and the use of Langchain framework in interpreting and responding to a wide array of user inputs. More importantly, you will have built a comprehensive chatbot application that is sure to impress!

Before we get started, let’s familiarize ourselves with the key elements we’ll be using.

### Flask
Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, known for its simplicity and speed. A web framework is a software framework designed to support the development of web applications, including the creation of web servers, and managing HTTP requests and responses.

We will use Flask to create the server side or back-end of our chatbot. This involves handling incoming messages from users, processing these messages, and sending appropriate responses back to the user.

### Langchain
Langchain is a versatile tool for building AI-driven language applications. It provides various functionalities such as text retrieval, summarization, translation, and many more, by leveraging pre-trained language models. In this project, we will be integrating Langchain into our chatbot, empowering it to understand and respond to diverse user inputs effectively.

### Chatbots
Chatbots are software applications designed to engage in human-like conversation. They can respond to text inputs from users and are widely used in various domains, including customer service, eCommerce, and education. In this project, you will build a chatbot capable of not only engaging users in a general conversation but also answering queries based on a particular document.

### Routes in Flask
Routes are an essential part of web development. When your application receives a request from a client (typically a web browser), it needs to know how to handle that request. This is where routing comes in.

In Flask, routes are created using the @app.route decorator to bind a function to a URL route. When a user visits that URL, the associated function is executed. In our chatbot project, we will use routes to handle the POST requests carrying user messages and to process document data.

### HTML - CSS - Javascript
We’ve provided a ready-to-use chatbot front-end, built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML structures web content, CSS styles it, and Javascript adds interactivity. These technologies create a visually appealing and interactive chatbot interface.


### Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of Langchain and AI applications
- Set up a development environment for building an assistant using Python Flask
- Implement PDF upload functionality to allow the assistant to understand file input from users
- Integrate the assistant with OpenAI’s GPT-3 model to give it a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and respond to user requests


### Prerequisites
Having knowledge of the basics of HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python are nice to have but not essential. We will do our best in explaining each step of the process as well as any code shown along the way.
